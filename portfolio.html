            <p>My husband and I, vacationing in the area, had lunch Fri 17th at The Corner and we were both absolutely pleased with everything at your place. Your wait staff was so pleasant and helpfull. Your menu is class. Do not change a thing!! The kitchen, the staff, the menu, the pizza(I couldn’t eat another bite so I took a Pepperoni pizza to go) are all the finest. I will recommend to everyone The Corner. Don’t change a thing! You are spot on!</p>

            <p>We were at The Corner a few weeks ago with some clients. I am finally getting back to tell you that we had a wonderful evening! The food, the service, the host, EVERYTHING was perfect! Thank you again for making TFG such a special place to be.

                We hope to see you again soon. Keep up the good work !</p>

            <p>Thank you for dinner last night. It was amazing!! I have to say it’s the best meal I have had in quite some time. You will definitely be seeing more of me eating at your establishment. My husband was very impressed and we can’t wait for our parents to come visit so that we can share our new favorite place with them.</p>
